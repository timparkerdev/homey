      <p class="mt-6 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">Welcome to my sample app for the Homey development task. I have built this sample app using Rails 8 + tailwind - I chose not to use any gems to provide any functionality, but in an actual project it might be beneficial to do so (particuarly around audits and comments).</p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">I chose not to introduce a User / authentication model to save time. The UI is mostly taken from TailwindUI.</p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">I'm pretty happy with my solution, but if had more time might reconsider improving the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mt-2 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">â€¢ Adding some tests - particularly the ProjectHistory service class to ensure correct formatting of the audit logs. Some nice high level feature tests would be good to test comment posting, and project editing.</li>
        <li class="mt-2 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">â€¢ A more thoughtful approach to partials, in particular shared buttons, layouts etc. This would likely form a wider Design System, to ensure UI code is not duplicated across views.</li>
        <li class="mt-2 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">â€¢ In a real project, we would need to consider user authentication, and authorisation.</li>
      <ul>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">I hope you enjoy reviewing my solution, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg/8 text-gray-600">Many thanks,</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-pretty text-base/7 text-gray-600">Presented here are some questions I would ask about the brief. For most of these, I've assumed an agile approach to delivery, whereby the focus is on shipping a usable MVP, which can be expanded on easily ðŸ˜Š.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-pretty text-base/7 text-gray-600">Given this conversation, I have chosen to make the project status dynamic (database based) from the start. This is not a particuarly difficult thing to add now, but would be more difficult to migrate to in the future, so is a complexity probably worth adding at the beginning.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-pretty text-base/7 text-gray-600">Given the answer to <strong>What other things might we want to show in the feed?</strong> I put a bit more effort into the ProjectHistory class, to allow it to be customisable to easily add additional attributes into the feed in the future.</p>
